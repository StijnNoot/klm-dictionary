# KLM Abbreviations, the Dictionary (in XDXF & Apple formats)

## Installation

See _Development > Building_ and _Installing to User's Dictionaries_ sections.

### Hinnts

1. In _Preferences_ of Dictionary.app you can drag the _KLM Abbreviations_ entry to the top to make it first priority.
2. You can _Look Up_ words from any place: force-push the word or control-click selected text. Then, in the contextual
   menu that appears, choose Look Up.

## Development

The source is in [XSXF format](https://github.com/soshial/xdxf_makedict/tree/master/format_standard) which is converted to
Apple Dictionary format with the help of [PyGlossary](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary) and then slightly tuned (see [build.sh](build.sh)).

NOTE: XDXF is not fully supported by PyGlossary, so be carefull â€“ don't overcomplicate.

### Setup
